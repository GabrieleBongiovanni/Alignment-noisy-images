# Alignment-noisy-images
Test code for the alignment of images in the presence of noise

There are various application in electron microscopy in which the probe current is kept to a minimum. In a number of cases a high current damages the specimen under study. In time-resolved electron microscopy, coulombic repulsion between electrons deteriorates the quality of the beam, and images are acquired with only few electrons.
Signal can emerge from noise if a sufficient number of images is averaged. However, for the averaging to work
